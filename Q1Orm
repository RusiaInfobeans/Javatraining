Orm Stands for object relation mapping.
It operates on the objects.So the whole methodology followed by ORMs is dependent on the object-oriented Concepts.
ORMs generate objects which map to tables in the database virtually.
Once these objects are up, then it can easily work to retrieve, manipulate or delete any field from the table without
paying much attention to language specifically.
ORM lets us use classes instead of database tables, and those classes implement DBAL to save you from writing queries.
