HashMap and LinkedHashMap are common implementation of Map.
The main difference between HashMap and LinkedHashMap is that LinkedHashMap maintains insertion order of keys,
order in which keys are inserted to LinkedHashMap while HashMap does not maintain any order of keys.
LinkedHashMap requires more memory than HashMap because of the ordering feature.
Internally LinkedHashMap uses doubly Linked List to maintain order of elements.
