List is an ordered sequence of elements whereas Set is a distinct list of elements which is unordered.
We  can add duplicate in list but in set duplicate is not allowed.
List permits any number of null values in its collection while Set permits only one null value in its collection.
New methods are defined inside List interface .
But, no new methods are defined inside Set interface, so we have to use Collection interface methods only with Set subclasses .
List can be inserted in in both forward direction and backward direction using List iterator,
while Set can be traversed only in forward direction with the help of iterator.
List is an ordered sequence of elements, however set is distinct list of element which is unordered.
So, we use list for storing non-unique objects as per insertion order and use set for storing unique objects in random order
