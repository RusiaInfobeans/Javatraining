Association in hibernate tells the relationship between the objects  classes.
That is how the entities are related to each other.
there are 4 type of association that is:-
one to one
one to many
many to many
many to many

A one-to-one association is similar to many-to-one association with a difference that the column will be set as unique.
For example, an address object can be associated with a single employee object.

One To Many Mapping in Hibernate. In simple terms, one to many mapping means that one row in a table can be mapped
to multiple rows in another table. For example, think of a Cart system where we have another table for Items.

A many-to-one association is the most common kind of association where an Object can be associated with multiple objects.
For example, the same address object can be associated with multiple employee objects.

Hibernate many to many mapping is made between two entities where one can have relation with multiple other entity
instances. For example, for a subscription service SubscriptionEntity and ReaderEntity can be two type of entities
Any subscription can have multiple readers, where a reader can subscribe to multiple subscriptions.
